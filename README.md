# uttu
---
simple + minimal P2P networking library.

uttu (currently) only has support for linux systems.

---
given that (eventually), all OC libraries aren't going to be hosted on the same platform (git-\*), it makes sense to keep some log within the git repo itself.

- All current **known and library wide** issues are stored in [bounty](docs/bounty.txt) 
- All intended features / the current roadmap are/is stored in [roadmap](docs/roadmap.txt)


#### dependency
uttu is dependent on crypto++.
